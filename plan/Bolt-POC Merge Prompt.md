As a solutions architect, review the front-end code in this repository https://github.com/geniusboywonder/botarmy-poc.git and this mockup front-end
https://github.com/geniusboywonder/RealBotArmyUI-Bolt.git

Put together a report in markdown (for download) that plans in detail how to use the RealBotArmyUI-Bolt UI front-end design in the botarmy-poc implementation.

Be sure to clearly identify each module, code file, depenencies needed as well as reccomendations for improvment/fixes. Be sure to size the work required for each element, along with estimate LOC, and estimate how long it will take to complete. 

Once all code and work has been identified, include a step-by step plan in your markown document to implement.

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CODE or EXAMPLES in your document.
