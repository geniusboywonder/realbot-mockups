# React Component Analysis: Agent Manager UI

This document breaks down the components of the Agent Manager UI, based on the code in `src/App.tsx`. The application is built as a single large component, but for the purpose of this analysis, it has been divided into its logical, constituent parts.

## 1. `App` (Root Component)

*   **Description:**
    The `App` component is the root of the application, a single, all-encompassing component that manages the entire UI and its state. It initializes and controls all the application's data, including the list of agents, chat messages, logs, and user settings. It uses state to dynamically render different "pages" and manages global features like dark mode and sidebar visibility.

*   **UI Placement:**
    As the root component, it wraps the entire application. All other components are rendered within it.

*   **Interdependencies:**
    *   **State Management:** Manages numerous state variables using `useState`, including `activePage`, `darkMode`, `sidebarCollapsed`, `agents`, `chatMessages`, `logs`, etc.
    *   **Child Components:** Renders all other logical components based on its state. For example, it shows the `Dashboard Page` when `activePage` is 'dashboard'.
    *   **Event Handling:** Contains the primary logic for handling events, such as keyboard shortcuts (`useEffect` for `âŒ˜K`), and simulates real-time data updates for agents and notifications.

*   **Markdown Mockup:**
    ```
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | [Header: Title, Status, Controls]                                 |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | [Sidebar] | [Main Content Area: (Active Page Content)]            |
    |           |                                                       |
    |           |                                                       |
    |           |                                                       |
    |           |                                                       |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

## 2. `Header`

*   **Description:**
    The `Header` is the top bar of the application. It provides branding, key status indicators, and global UI controls. It displays the application title ("Agent Manager"), connection status, overall agent system status, and statistics like active agents and task queue size. It also contains buttons to toggle the command palette, collapse the sidebar, and switch between light and dark modes.

*   **UI Placement:**
    Fixed at the top of the screen.

*   **Interdependencies:**
    *   **Relies on `App` state:** `connectionStatus`, `agents`, `sidebarCollapsed`, `darkMode`.
    *   **Triggers `App` actions:** `setShowCommandPalette`, `setSidebarCollapsed`, `setDarkMode`.

*   **Markdown Mockup:**
    ```

## 3. `Sidebar`

*   **Description:**
    The `Sidebar` is the primary navigation element of the application. It presents a list of navigable pages, each with an icon and a name. It can be collapsed to a smaller, icon-only view to save space. When collapsed, hovering over an icon reveals a tooltip with the page name.

*   **UI Placement:**
    On the left side of the screen.

*   **Interdependencies:**
    *   **Relies on `App` state:** `activePage` (to highlight the current page), `sidebarCollapsed`.
    *   **Triggers `App` actions:** `setActivePage(pageId)`.
